# Creating a Tic Tac Toe Game with React

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that's perfect for learning the basics of React. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps of building a simple Tic Tac Toe game from scratch. By the end, you'll have a functional game and a better understanding of React fundamentals.

## Getting Started

Before we dive in, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), which includes npm.

Create a new React application using Create React App:

````bash
npx create-react-app tic-tac-toe
cd tic-tac-toe

## Project Structure
In your project directory, you’ll mainly work with the `src` folder. Here’s the structure we’ll use:

```scss
src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── Board.js
  │   ├── Square.js
  └── App.js
````

## Building the components

### Square Component

First, create the `Square` component. This component represents a single square on the Tic Tac Toe board.

```jsx
import React from "react";

function Square({ value, onClick }) {
    return (
        <button className="square" onClick={onClick}>
            {value}
        </button>
    );
}

export default Square;
```

## Board Component

Next, create the `Board` component. This component renders the entire Tic Tac Toe board and handles the game logic.

Create a file `src/components/Board.js`

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Square from "./Square";

function Board() {
    const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));
    const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true);

    const handleClick = (i) => {
        const newSquares = squares.slice();
        if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) return;
        newSquares[i] = xIsNext ? "X" : "O";
        setSquares(newSquares);
        setXIsNext(!xIsNext);
    };

    const winner = calculateWinner(squares);
    let status;
    if (winner) {
        status = `Winner: ${winner}`;
    } else {
        status = `Next player: ${xIsNext ? "X" : "O"}`;
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <div>{status}</div>
            <div>
                {[0, 1, 2].map((row) => (
                    <div key={row}>
                        {[0, 1, 2].map((col) => (
                            <Square
                                key={row * 3 + col}
                                value={squares[row * 3 + col]}
                                onClick={() => handleClick(row * 3 + col)}
                            />
                        ))}
                    </div>
                ))}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}

function calculateWinner(squares) {
    const lines = [
        [0, 1, 2],
        [3, 4, 5],
        [6, 7, 8],
        [0, 3, 6],
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2, 5, 8],
        [0, 4, 8],
        [2, 4, 6],
    ];
    for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
        const [a, b, c] = lines[i];
        if (
            squares[a] &&
            squares[a] === squares[b] &&
            squares[a] === squares[c]
        ) {
            return squares[a];
        }
    }
    return null;
}

export default Board;
```

## App Component

Finally, use the `Board` component in the `App` component.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Board from "./components/Board";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
            <Board />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve built a functional Tic Tac Toe game using React. This simple project demonstrates key React concepts such as components, state, and event handling. From here, you can extend the game with features like a restart button, score tracking, or an AI opponent.

Feel free to experiment and customize the game to suit your preferences. Happy coding!
